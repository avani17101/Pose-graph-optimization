    "In this project, we are going to use a non-linear weighted least squares optimization approach to solve the problem of getting a better estimate of our robot's trajectory. Least squares formulations are widely used for optimization, be it computer vision or robotics or machine learning. We will dive deep into it during this project and you will have complete clarity on optimization for vector-valued residual functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this \"Introduction\" section, I am going to provide an introduction for SLAM problem for a robot operating in the 2D world. It is 2. section in this Project. The 1D SLAM problem (1.) is far much simpler to understand and will be described directly in the 1. section. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2D world, a robot has 3 degrees of freedom, i.e. its pose in the world can be expressed by the state vector $\\mathbf{x}=(x, y, \\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}}$. For the scope of this project, we are interested only in the robot's trajectory through the $2 \\mathrm{D}$ world, and NOT in distinct landmarks or the surronding map of the environment, i.e. we are only interested in \"L\"ocalization part of SLAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can represent it as a graph where the vertices represent robot poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and edges represent the spatial constraints between these poses. Such a map is generally called a pose graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different kinds of constraints are necessary for pose graph SLAM. The first are\n",
    "odometric constraints that connect two successive states $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}$ via a motion model. Furthermore, in order to perform loop closing, the robot has to recognize places it already visited before. This place recognition is also a part of the front-end and provides the second type of constraint, the loop closure constraints. These constraints connect two not necessarily successive poses $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{j}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Even the loop closure nodes are related by the above model, except that it need not necessarily be consecutive notes k and k+1.\n",

    "Save this initial trajectory as `edges-poses.g2o`.\n",

    "2. Now calculate the residual and the Jacobian and update your parameters using LM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use LM algorithm. Regarding Jacobian calculation, you can use `jax`'s `jacobian` as part of your main code. However, you still have to separately calculate it analytically and verify if it matches with `jax`'s `jacobian` using [[CP-M]] frobenius norm `frobNorm()`). Calculation and verification is compulsory, but it is your choice to use whichever as part of your optimization. Use whichever is faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regarding LM iterations, stopping criterion, information matrix values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. [[CP-B]] As your iterations proceed, you have to print relevant information (iteration number and error value: [$F = \\frac{1}{2}  \\mathbf{f}^{\\top} \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} $ (notion page link)](https://www.notion.so/saishubodh/From-linear-algebra-to-non-linear-weighted-least-squares-optimization-13cf17d318be4d45bb8577c4d3ea4a02#32832dee7d6c4ab49581463d9b784f21) at every step).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. [[CP-B]] You have to show the plots (ground truth, noisy & optimized: all 3 in a single plot) at every 10 steps or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. [[CP-M]] You could start with information values of 500 for odom edges, 700 for loop closure edges, 1000 for anchor edge (same for all dimensions). However, you have to _heavily_ experiment with these values. (Given that you somehow know loop closure information is way more reliable than odometry.). At the end of your experimentation, your error $F = \\frac{1}{2}  \\mathbf{f}^{\\top} \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\mathbf{f} $ should by < 40. Explain your experimentation in detail using tables/plots etc if necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Do not worry if you're not getting a perfect trajectory. Our parametrization was oversimplified for the sake of this project. With that being said, it is possible to get the error down to < 40 and make it at least look like an oval shaped trajectory, even if it doesn't perfectly resemble the ground truth. However, using `g2o` (next section), you will be getting a close to ground truth trajectory."

When I run the above code, it should follow points described above (such as plots at every 10 steps) and (When I run the above code, it should) write the optimized poses to a file named `opt.g2o`. As a backup, save another file `opt_backup.g2o` in an offline manner beforehand.\n",

You have to add useful metrics/plots from `EVO` (refer to supplementary notebook). Using EVO, the bare minimum you have to report is `mean absolute pose error (ape)` and `mean relative pose error (rpe)`. However, you are encouraged to use tools like `evo_traj` and [more](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo/#command-line-interface) and add more plots/metrics.
